# e2-moderation-codes
e2s that are made purely for moderation purposes or ingame utility in general


basicly all of these go together or separately, the egp protection controller is used with fading door addon to create a powerful egp protection, basicly when the block that covers the egps is faded no one can use the egps,
unless they noclip into the prop and get lucky and manage to hit E on the egp, to prevent this, the Fade2 variable can be wired to a fading door that is placed to the egp huds
this way they will fade themselfs as the block covers it, making it impossible to connect to them without it being open.

2 e2s that show e2s and egps through the map, e2s cpu usage and owner

1 egp that goes together with the player spectator e2

e2 debug tool, this one can be used in many cases, check all e2s on map, their cpu usage, owner and the id which is used for checking more info of them such as ops
of course you can also debug them, this will basicly benchmark it, you can see your average cpu and ops using it, useful for checking if you want to know if your e2 is optimized as well

for the 2 e2s that show e2s and egps a small portion was just copy pasted from another public e2, player esp, i did change it a bit tho, first of all it doesn't show players at all, just the e2s and such


some of these codes do exist in my "coding" section, it's a random mess of e2s i have made, this is more organized in case someone stumbles onto my file repository
in case you do, do enjoy all of these, feel free to modify them as you please, and if you find improvements to some and such, or decide to recreate them, go ahead i don't mind, just don't take straight up copies of these and reupload them, ofc linking them back here would be fine, as in taking the link of any of my files and putting it somewhere where people can find these from
